## About the Collection

The Harlem Renaissance Collection takes a look at the vibrant cultural, artistic movement of the 1920s to the 1930's. This collection is perfect for students, educators, and researchers who are interested in a brief look into the time period. This collection features notable art, music, literature, and more. I hope you will learn: 

- about the culture during this time period
- Notable figures during this time

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
